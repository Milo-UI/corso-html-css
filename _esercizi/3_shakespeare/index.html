                <h1>Sonnet 18</h1>
                <h2>William Shakespeare</h2>

                <p>
                    Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? <br>
                    Thou art more lovely and more temperate. <br>
                    Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, <br>
                    And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, <br>
                    And often is his gold complexion dimmed, <br>
                    And every fair from fair sometime declines, <br>
                    By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed;
                </p>

                <p>
                    But thy eternal summer shall not fade, <br>
                    Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest; <br>
                    Nor shall Death brag thou wand'rest in his shade, <br>
                    When in eternal lines to time thou grow rest.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, <br>
                    So long lives this and this gives life to thee.
                </p>
